# HelloWorldGenerator
##### Tired of writing Hello World yourself? Now there is a program that will do it for you!
#### What is Hello World Generator? 
Hello World Generator is a program that writes a simple Hello World program for you.
#### How do I use it?
Build, compile and run. Say if you want to greet someone in particular or the whole world. Then compile and run your brand new Hello World program, to see if it works.
#### Why? 
I don't know, I found it amusing. It's an exercise on automatic code writing. Maybe soon I will try to write something that's actually useful.
#### What can I do with it?
Probably play for 1 or 2 minutes and get bored. Have fun!
